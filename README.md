## A coding exercise
Using Java's object-oriented design and generic programming capabilities, to make the code,
* simpler
* more concise
* more understandable
* self documentation - the code (comments included) is the documentation
* more manageable

Here, "manageable" means the following,
* reusability - ease of reuse
* adaptable - ease of change
* extendable - ease of adding more features to existing classes
* expandable - ease of adding more classes

## What it is not trying to accomplish,
